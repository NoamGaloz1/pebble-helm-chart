# This is a GitHub workflow defining a set of jobs with a set of steps.
# ref: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions
#
# This workflow test the Helm chart in the following ways:
#
#   1. runs `helm lint`
#   2. runs `helm install` with the `--wait` flag to ensure that pods startup and
#      enters a ready state.
#   3. runs `helm test` that runs primitive tests defined as part of the Helm chart
#      under pebble/templates/tests to verify things seem to work.
